      Robots are being used more widely in society for purposes that are
      increasing in sophistication such as complex assembly, picking and
      packing, last-mile delivery, environmental monitoring, search and rescue,
      and assisted surgery. Within the autonomous mobile robot (AMR) and
      <mark>autonomous ground vehicle (AGV)</mark>autonomous ground vehicle
      (AGV) market segments, robots are being used for commercial logistics and
      consumer cleaning, delivery, and companionship.

      These jobs require higher compute capabilities and often the orchestration
      of the deployment and operations of large fleets of robots. To function
      effectively, the robots require the integration of technologies such as
      <mark>image recognition</mark>, sensing, artificial intelligence, machine
      learning, and reinforcement learning in ways new to the field of robotics.
      Developing, simulating, and deploying smart robotics applications is
      difficult and time consuming. Now, with AWS RoboMaker, it is easy to
      enable a robot running ROS to navigate, communicate, comprehend, stream
      data, and learn. Tasks that once could either not be done or took months
      can now be done in hours or days.
